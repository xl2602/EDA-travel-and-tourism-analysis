## Introduction
International travel has become so easy that anyone can just grab his/her bags and documents and starts a new journey. As one of the most tourists importing and exporting countries, the USA has always played a significant role in worldâ€™s tourism industry. Therefore, we want to study people who traveled to and from the USA by investigating the Travel and Tourism Statistical data provided by The National Travel & Tourism Office (NTTO). To be more precise, we want to answer following questions:

- What are the most popular international travel destinations for Americans?

- What are the main regions of people who travel to the USA?

- What are the purposes and spending of travels to and from the USA?

- Does the economy matter for the answers to above questions?
